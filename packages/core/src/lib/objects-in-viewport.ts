/**
 * Returns objects that overlap with the viewport bounds.

 * @param viewport - The viewport bounds to check against
 * @param objects - Array of objects MUST be sorted by position (y for column, x for row direction)
 * @param direction - Primary scroll direction: "column" (vertical) or "row" (horizontal)
 * @param padding - Extra padding around viewport to include nearby objects
 * @param minTriggerSize - Minimum array size to use binary search optimization
 * @returns Array of visible objects sorted by zIndex
 *
 * @remarks
 * Objects must be pre-sorted by their start position (y for column direction, x for row direction).
 * Unsorted input will produce incorrect results.
